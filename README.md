## Usage

This is a collection of missing features from [TextMate 2.0 Alpha](http://blog.macromates.com/2011/textmate-2-0-alpha/).
This bundle includes:

### <kbd>⌃⌘S</kbd> Save Project

The save project command will now create a `.tm_properties` in the current file browser folder
precompiled with `projectDirectory` set and an example `windowTitle` featuring the
current scm-branch and the `$projectDirectory` basename

**Example:**
```
 application.rb     ☛master     [awesome-app]
```

This command also saves the project in the favorities (accessible with `⌘⇧O`).


### <kbd>⎋</kbd> Character class indifferent completion

TextMate 2 [introduced](http://blog.macromates.com/2012/clever-completion/) strict …err …clever completion, which will not cross boundaries between character classes anymore. For example in Ruby typing `au` and hitting `⎋` for autocompletion will not pick `:auto` or `@autocomplete` since they have a leading `:` and `@` and the belong to the *symbol* and *instance variable* character classes.

This bundle reintroduces the TM1 behavior.


### <kbd>⌃⎋</kbd> Cross tab completion

[RubyAMP](http://code.leadmediapartners.com/) used to have this.


### <kbd>⌃⌥⌘T</kbd> Open Project directory in terminal

_NOTE: requires OSX Lion_

Opens the current project directory in the terminal (not really present in TM1, but useful anyway).
 
By default will open Terminal, if you prefer anoter terminal app you can set in `.tm_properties` a variable: `TM_TERMINAL_APP = "iTerm.app"`


### <kbd>⌃⌥⌘L</kbd> Keep current file as reference

> …waiting for split panes

Outputs the current source into the bottom html pane, this makes the current file source visible while changing tabs.

Seems that most of the need for split panes is to keep one file as a reference, this solves this particular issue.


### <kbd>⌥⌘,</kbd> Open the global `.tm_properties`

Tired of opening `.tm_properties` from the terminal or browsing to it by hand?

Now you can just hit `⌥⌘,` and bring up your alternative preferences (from you the home folder).


### <kbd>⌃⌥⌘,</kbd> Open the project `.tm_properties`

Now you can just hit `⌃⌥⌘,` and bring up your alternative preferences (from the current project).


### <kbd>⌘S</kbd> Strip trailing whitespace on save

Just add `TM_STRIP_WHITESPACE_ON_SAVE = true` to your `.tm_properties`.
Ending newline fix is included.

**BEWARE:** The command **strips whitespace before writing to disk but not in the editor window**, this is a feature to me
but I understand that some users would prefer to have the editor updated. If you're of that kind you'll have to modify the bundle manually
and replace `callback.document.export` with `callback.document.will-save`
([screenshot](http://cl.ly/image/0r2s3s3v3d0t/Screen%20Shot%202014-07-21%20at%2001.44.46.png)).

### <kbd>⌘S</kbd> Add newline at end of file

Just add `TM_ENSURE_TRAILING_NEWLINE_ON_SAVE = true` to your `.tm_properties`.

This won't add a second newline if you also have `TM_STRIP_WHITESPACE_ON_SAVE`.

### <del><kbd>⌃⌘N</kbd> New File</del> → <kbd>⇧⌘N</kbd> (builtin)

Removed as <kbd>⇧⌘N</kbd> has been introduced as a builtin command.

### <kbd>⌥⏎</kbd> Insert new line above

This is like `O` (vs. `o` which is <kbd>⌘⏎</kbd>) in `vim`.
